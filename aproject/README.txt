(!UNFINISHED!)
This is the final project of the CS50 course.
I decided to develop a web application for creating, tracking and maintaining habits of user's choice. 
User can create a habit, choose some specifications (like duration etc.), 
and evaluates on a daily basis, how well they acomplished the habit.
The user sees all their habits and gets a statistic of how well they are doing.
It uses relational databases to keep track of different users and their passwords, active habits, evaluations etc.

Note: the website doesn't not run on any domain yet.
